Deorphanizing gene-distal non-coding cancer-associated somatic mutations with chromatin interactions in breast cancer

&ensp;&ensp;Somatic alterations of the genome are a leading cause of cancer development and progression.<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;While advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the discovery of alterations in protein-coding genes in large cohorts of cancer-derived samples, genome-wide surveys of somatic alterations also revealed that a subsequent amount are also located within non-coding regions of the genome.<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;Unravelling the implications of somatic mutations in non-coding and intergenic regions of the genome is still a challenge, one that needs to be solved to enable personalized medicine. Given that recent findings indicate that disease-associated polymorphisms are commonly located in regulatory regions of the genome, we posit that clusters of both somatic and germ-line non-coding variants can have a regulatory effect on gene expression through 3-dimensional genome organization.<br/><br/>
&ensp;&ensp;To deorphanize somatic mutations which, through chromatin interactions, are in close spatial proximity with target genes, we mined ChIA-PET-derived chromatin interactions in a breast cancer model, MCF-7. 
   * We compared this data with breast cancer-associated mutations identified from COSMIC and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) from breast cancer studies.
   * We identified hundreds of chromatin loops between non-coding variants and known gene promoter regions. 
   * Examining a network of non-coding variants associated with genes through chromatin interactions, we identified that several non-coding variants in different enhancers could connect recurrently to the same gene. 
   * Also, we observed non-coding variants that affect multiple genes.<br/><br/>
&ensp;&ensp;Taken together, these results lay a framework for better understanding of the effects of distal non-coding variants on putative target genes through chromatin interactions
